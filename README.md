# Union-Find-Decoder

My Master Thesis project. This repository will contain a benchmark workflow designed with Stim to deploy an optimized Union-Find Decoder for Quantum Surface Codes. The general purpose is to experiment how to benchmark and test a general decoding pipeline, beyond "classical" decoding techniques.
